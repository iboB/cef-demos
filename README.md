# CEF Demos

Small CEF Demos

*More docs to come*

## Demos

The simple demos have no external dependencies other than CEF and the cef.dll wrapper.

* **cefsimple** - A copy of the cefsimple test from the CEF project. Here to make sure everything is backwards compatible.
* **simple** - A bare-bones minimal example which launches a browser.
* **simple-headless** - A minimal headless browser example

The other demos depend on the `demos-common` library defined [here](common).

* **resource** - Uses a resource manager to load files from the `html` subdirectory
* **file-manager** - A file manager demo with HTML GUI
